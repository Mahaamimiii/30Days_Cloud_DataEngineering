Day 5 of my Cloud + Data Science Challenge, I focused on visualizing ML model predictions using Power BI. After training my model on the Mall Customers dataset, I stored predictions in Azure Blob Storage and connected it directly to Power BI.
✅ Built charts like:
 🔹 Predicted vs Actual Spending Score
 🔹 Confidence Levels per Prediction
 🔹 Income vs Predicted Score Scatterplot

🔁 Step-by-Step Guide: Connect Colab to Power BI
🔹 Connected Google Colab to Azure Blob Storage to store ML predictions
 🔹 Linked Power BI Desktop with Azure Blob for real-time data visualization
 🔹 Created charts: Predicted vs Actual, Spending patterns, and Confidence levels
 🔹 Published interactive dashboard to Power BI Service for sharing insights

This visual pipeline helps turn complex model outputs into insightful business decisions. Plus, publishing to Power BI Service enables real-time dashboarding and sharing with stakeholders.
