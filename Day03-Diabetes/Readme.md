Today I completed the preprocessing pipeline for my diabetes classification dataset retrieved from Azure Blob Storage ☁️📊
🔧 Tasks Completed:
 ✅ Dropped unnecessary columns
 ✅ Encoded gender values (F/M → 0/1)
 ✅ Split data into features and labels
 ✅ Scaled features using StandardScaler
 ✅ Performed train-test split (80-20)
Now the dataset is fully prepped and ML-ready!
 Up next: model training and evaluation 🔍
🧠 Tools Used: Azure Blob | Python | Pandas | Scikit-learn
